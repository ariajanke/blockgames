# Block Games
## Assorted Block Game Suite

This application is an assortment of classic block matching puzzle games.

Games added so far are derived from these well known classics (links to Wikipedia):
- [Puyo Puyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyo_Puyo)
- [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)
- [Same Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame)
- [Columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columns_(video_game))

## Other Features
There are plans to add "scenarios" to some of the games, to add more interesting game play. Players
also have the ability change around their "free play" games via the settings menu. Also some scenarios
can use "free play" settings.

## Current Development Stage
Nondemonstrable (Stage 1/4)

In order to reach the demonstrable stage, I need to add features such that a user can use/learn how to 
use this application without "just knowing". This will involved changes to the README and include
instructions presented in the app.

## Goals
- 12 Scenarios for the Puyo derivative
    * 3 non-sequential scenarios
    * 1 special pop forever "screen saver"
    * 8 sequential unlockable scenarios
- 4 Scenarios for the Tetris derivative
- Free Play Modes for the remaining two games
- About/How to play dialog

### Additional goals as of 11-19
- Re-assignable controls
- Have configuration accessible to free play scenarios, in scenario select.
    * each free play scenario has it's own configuration
- Instructions presented in game(?)
